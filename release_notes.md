# Microchip MPLAB® Harmony 3 Event Recorder Release Notes

## Overview

Event Recorder enables capturing of events like function calls, tasks switching, CPU usage and memory usage. The event logs can help understand the application behavior and identify errors. The events can be plotted for easy analysis and pinpointing trouble spots. The Event Recorder has the following features:
  - Lightweight instrumentation of application code of events to be captured
  - Captured events are buffered on device and streamed over SWD to PC. There is no need for specialized debugging setup / tools.
  - Works with Cortex devices.
  - Event logs can be displayed in various plots.
  - Event logs can be saved and loaded for later analysis.

## Software

The Event Recorder require the following software:
- [MPLAB®X IDE v6.10](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-x-ide#tabs)
- [MPLAB® Code Configurator plugin](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/configure/mplab-code-configurator)
- [MPLAB® XC32 Compiler](https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/mplab-xc-compilers)

## Documentation

The documentation for this project can be found in the docs' folder or in the MPLABX online documentation. 

## Special considerations

To ensure that Event Recorder functions correctly and produces the expected results, please follow these steps for proper configuration:

- Include Event Recorder Configuration file. This is file is generated by MCC.
- Configure scvd file in your project.
- Open the Event Recorder view before starting debugging session: MPLAB X Windows Menu -> Event Recorder


## Known issues

| SSR | Description |
| --- | --- |
| MPLABX-7651 | When plotting high-rate live data updating/rendering of plots may be lagging. To fix this reduce the number of events being logged, or reduce the clock, or halt the debugging session to let the rendering catch up.|
| MPLABX-7652 | If the rate of captured events is higher than the buffer and flushing of the buffer can handle events will be dropped.  To avoid dropping events increase the memory buffer size, or reduce the clock frequency, or/and reduce the number of instrumented events in the code.|
| MPLABX-7654 | Open Event Recorder view before starting the debugging session. MPLAB X Windows Menu -> Event Recorder.|
| MPLABX-7661 | The zoom and rotate functions are not available while the debugger is running. Pause or stop the debugging before zooming and rotating views.|
| MPLABX-7675  | The memory allocation plot does not support clearing of data while debugging is running. If the data is cleared the debugging session must be restarted to get correct plot of allocated memory.|
